  **Design Movement**: **Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) meets Fintech Brutalism**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Radical Clarity**: Data is the hero. No decorative fluff. Every pixel serves the information.
  2.  **Grid Precision**: A strict, mathematical grid system that governs all placement, creating a sense of trust and stability.
  3.  **High Contrast**: Bold, stark contrasts to highlight critical signals (risk vs. opportunity).
  4.  **Asymmetric Balance**: Dynamic layouts that feel modern and active, avoiding static symmetry.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Monochrome Foundation**: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) and stark white (#ffffff) for maximum readability.
  -   **Signal Colors**: Neon Green (#00ff41) for growth/safety, Alert Orange (#ff4500) for risk/volatility. Used sparingly but effectively.
  -   **Intent**: To convey a sense of institutional-grade seriousness with a modern, algorithmic edge.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Modular Dashboard**: A bento-box style layout where each metric lives in its own clearly defined cell.
  -   **Sticky Sidebar**: A persistent left navigation for context, keeping the main stage for data.
  -   **Density Control**: High information density without clutter, achieved through perfect spacing.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Oversized Typography**: Key numbers (like the SELIC rate) are treated as graphic elements, massive and bold.
  -   **Micro-Charts**: Sparklines and small area charts integrated directly into data cards.
  -   **Monospace Accents**: Use of a monospaced font for all data values to emphasize the "raw data" aspect.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Hover-to-Reveal**: Cards remain clean until hovered, revealing deeper context or historical comparisons.
  -   **Instant Feedback**: Immediate visual response to any interaction, feeling snappy and precise.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Staggered Entry**: Elements load in a quick, cascaded sequence.
  -   **Value Counting**: Numbers count up/down to their final values on load.
  -   **Sharp Transitions**: No soft fades; instant, cut-like transitions between states.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Primary**: *Inter* or *Helvetica Now Display* (Bold/Black) for headlines.
  -   **Secondary**: *JetBrains Mono* or *Roboto Mono* for all data points and labels.

  **Design Movement**: **Neumorphism 2.0 (Soft UI) with Glassmorphism Accents**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Tactile Depth**: Elements feel like they can be touched and pressed.
  2.  **Soft Lighting**: Mimics natural light sources to create gentle shadows and highlights.
  3.  **Layered Translucency**: Glass-like panels floating above a blurred background.
  4.  **Fluidity**: Everything feels organic and connected.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Ethereal Palette**: Soft off-whites, pale grays, and muted pastels.
  -   **Gradient Accents**: Subtle gradients (Blue-Purple, Teal-Cyan) to indicate active states or positive trends.
  -   **Intent**: To make complex economic data feel approachable, calm, and sophisticated.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Floating Cards**: Content lives on soft, rounded cards that float above the background.
  -   **Central Focus**: Key metrics are centered and elevated, with supporting data radiating outwards.
  -   **Whitespace as Breath**: Generous padding to let the content breathe.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Soft Shadows**: Inner and outer shadows to create volume (concave/convex shapes).
  -   **Frosted Glass**: Background blur on overlays and sticky headers.
  -   **Rounded Corners**: Everything is heavily rounded (super-ellipses).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Press & Release**: Buttons and cards physically depress when clicked.
  -   **Smooth Gliding**: Hover effects are slow and buttery.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Float & Bob**: Subtle floating animation for idle elements.
  -   **Liquid Morphing**: Charts and graphs morph smoothly between states.
  -   **Soft Fades**: Everything transitions with long, ease-in-out curves.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Primary**: *Nunito* or *Quicksand* (Rounded sans-serif) for a friendly vibe.
  -   **Secondary**: *DM Sans* for body text.

  **Design Movement**: **Cyberpunk / High-Frequency Trading Terminal**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Information Overload (Controlled)**: Dense, rich data presentation for power users.
  2.  **Dark Mode Native**: Designed primarily for low-light environments.
  3.  **Tech-Forward**: Glitch effects, scanlines, and digital artifacts.
  4.  **Speed**: Visuals that imply velocity and real-time processing.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Deep Void**: Pure black (#000000) or very dark blue (#050510) background.
  -   **Neon Accents**: Cyber Cyan (#00f3ff), Laser Magenta (#ff00ff), and Electric Yellow (#ffee00).
  -   **Intent**: To make the user feel like an elite trader with access to a futuristic terminal.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Modular Grid**: Tightly packed grid of data modules.
  -   **HUD (Heads-Up Display)**: Overlays and floating data points.
  -   **Collapsible Panels**: Users can expand/collapse sections to customize their view.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Glowing Borders**: Active elements have a neon glow.
  -   **Scanlines**: Subtle horizontal lines overlaying charts.
  -   **Data Streams**: Background elements that look like flowing code or ticker tape.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Instant Response**: Zero latency feel.
  -   **Keyboard First**: Designed for hotkeys and rapid navigation.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Glitch Reveal**: Text decodes character by character.
  -   **Pulse**: Critical alerts pulse with a glowing effect.
  -   **Slide & Snap**: Panels slide in and snap into place mechanically.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Primary**: *Rajdhani* or *Orbitron* (Tech/Sci-fi look).
  -   **Secondary**: *Fira Code* or *Share Tech Mono* for data.
